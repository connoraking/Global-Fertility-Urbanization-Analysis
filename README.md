# Global-Fertility-Urbanization-Analysis
An R-based project that analyzes the connection between urbanization and fertility rates using UN provided data.

## Project Goal

### Resource allocation and planning

- Understanding the relationship between urbanization and fertility rates can assist in determining the demand for resources and services in both urban and rural areas. 
- This information can be used by governments and organizations to allocate resources more effectively for things such as healthcare, education, housing, and infrastructure.

### Economic Development 

- High fertility rates can strain resources and services, while rapid urban growth may lead to challenges in providing adequate infrastructure, housing, and job opportunities. 
- Identifying these relationships can help inform strategies to promote sustainable development and economic growth.
