# Global-Fertility-Urbanization-Analysis
An R-based project that analyzes the connection between urbanization and fertility rates using UN provided data.

## Project Goal

#### Resource allocation and planning

- Understanding the relationship between urbanization and fertility rates can assist in determining the demand for resources and services in both urban and rural areas. 
- This information can be used by governments and organizations to allocate resources more effectively for things such as healthcare, education, housing, and infrastructure.

#### Economic Development 

- High fertility rates can strain resources and services, while rapid urban growth may lead to challenges in providing adequate infrastructure, housing, and job opportunities. 
- Identifying these relationships can help inform strategies to promote sustainable development and economic growth.

## Data

- I obtained the data from the United Nations at data.un.org
- I used two separate datasets, one labeled “Population in the capital city, urban, and rural areas” and “Population growth, fertility, life expectancy, and mortality”

#### Variables 

- There were several variables included in these two data sets; however, the ones we were interested in were **urban percentage**, **urban percentage growth**, **rural percentage growth**, and **fertility rate**.
- Urban percentage measures the percentage of the country living in urban areas (cities)
- Urban percentage growth measures the percentage growth of the urban areas per year  tracked over a 5-year period preceding the reference year.
- Rural percentage growth measures the percentage growth of rural areas per year  tracked over a 5-year period preceding the reference year.

#### Proxies

- Urban population percentage is a proxy for the degree of urbanization, reflecting the proportion of the population living in urban areas. 
- Urban growth percentage and rural growth percentage are proxies for the rate at which urban and rural populations are changing, respectively, indicating the dynamics of urbanization over time.
